> ⚠️ **EXPERIMENTAL FORK - TEST ONLY**  
> This is a **fork** of the original [bjrnptrsn/climate_group_helper](https://github.com/bjrnptrsn/climate_group_helper) with experimental **Area-Based Window Control** functionality.  
> **DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION** - This is for testing purposes only!

## 🆕 New Features in This Fork

### 🪟 **Area-Based Window Control**
Revolutionary new window control mode that automatically manages thermostats based on window states **per area**:

- **🏠 Area-Aware**: Each window sensor controls only thermostats in its assigned Home Assistant area
- **⏱️ Configurable Delays**: Separate delays for window open (15s default) and close (30s default)
- **🔄 Event-Driven**: Real-time response to window state changes with intelligent timer management
- **🌐 Multi-Language**: Full Italian translation support with proper UI integration
- **🔧 Future-Proof**: Uses modern Home Assistant threading patterns (compatible with HA 2025.4+)

### 📋 How Area-Based Control Works

1. **Window Opens** → Timer starts (15s default)
2. **After delay** → System checks if window still open
3. **If yes** → Turns OFF all thermostats in the same area
4. **Window Closes** → Timer starts (30s default)  
5. **After delay** → Checks if other windows in area are still open
6. **If no other windows open** → Restores thermostats to group target mode

---

## ✨ Original Features (Unchanged)

### 🎛️ Unified Control
Change settings on the group, and all member devices update to match. No more managing 5 thermostats individually.

### 🌡️ Multi-Sensor Aggregation
Use **multiple external sensors** for temperature and humidity. The group calculates the average (or min/max/median) to get the true room reading—not just what one device thinks.
*   **Averaging:** Mean, Median, Min, or Max.
*   **Precision:** Round values to match your device (e.g. 0.5°).

### 🔄 Calibration Sync (Write Targets)
*New in v0.13!* Write the calculated sensor value **back to physical devices** (e.g. `number.thermostat_external_input`). Perfect for TRVs that support external temperature calibration.

### 🔒 Advanced Sync Modes
*   **Standard:** Classic one-way control (Group → Members).
*   **Mirror:** Two-way sync. Change one device, all others follow.
*   **Lock:** Enforce group state. Reverts manual changes on members.

### 🎚️ Selective Attribute Sync
*New in v0.13!* Choose **exactly** which attributes to sync in Lock/Mirror modes. Example: Sync temperature but allow individual fan control.

### 🪟 Window Control
*Redesigned in v0.16!* Automatically turn off heating when windows open and restore it when they close.

*   **Logic:** Opening a window forces all members to `off`. Closing the window restores the group's target state (e.g. `heat`).
*   **Room Sensor:** Fast reaction (default: 15s). For sensors directly in the room. E.g. `binary_sensor.living_room_window`.
*   **Zone Sensor:** Slow reaction (default: 5min). For whole-house sensors. Prevents heating shutdown in closed rooms when a distant window opens. E.g. `binary_sensor.all_windows_open`.
*   **User Blocking:** Manual changes are blocked while windows are open.
*   **Sync Blocking:** Background sync ignores changes during window control.

### 📅 Schedule Integration
*New in v0.16!* Native support for Home Assistant `schedule` entities.

*   **Direct Control:** Link a schedule helper to your climate group.
*   **Intelligent Sync:** The schedule updates the group's target state.
*   **Window Aware:** If a schedule changes while windows are open, the new target is saved and applied immediately when windows close.
*   **Format:** Supports `hvac_mode`, `temperature`, `fan_mode`, etc. via schedule variables.

#### Schedule Configuration Example

1. Create a **Schedule Helper** in Home Assistant (Settings > Devices & Services > Helpers).
2. Open the schedule and add your time slots.
3. **Crucial:** You must add **variables** (data) to your schedule slots to tell the group what to do.

**Example (Edit Schedule as YAML):**
```yaml
monday:
  - from: "06:00:00"
    to: "08:30:00"
    data:
      hvac_mode: "heat"
      temperature: 21.5
  - from: "08:30:00"
    to: "16:00:00"
    data:
      hvac_mode: "heat"
      temperature: 19.0
```

## ⚙️ Configuration Options

The configuration is organized into a wizard-style flow. Use the **Configure** button on the helper to change these settings.

### Temperature & Humidity Settings

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **External Sensors** | Select one or more sensors to override member readings. |
| **Calibration Targets** | Write calculated temperature to number entities. |
| **Averaging Method** | Mean, Median, Min, or Max—separately for Current and Target values. |
| **Precision** | Round target values sent to devices (e.g. 0.5° or 1°). |

### HVAC Mode Strategy

| Strategy | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| **Normal** | Group shows most common mode. Only `off` when all are off. |
| **Off Priority** | Group shows `off` if *any* device is off. |
| **Auto** | Smart switching between Normal and Off Priority. |

### Feature Strategy

| Strategy | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| **Intersection** | Features (e.g. Fan) supported by *all* devices. Safe mode. |
| **Union** | Features supported by *any* device. |

### Sync Mode

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Sync Mode** | Standard (One-way), Mirror (Two-way), or Lock (Enforced). |
| **Selective Sync** | Choose which attributes to enforce (e.g. sync temperature but allow local fan control). |

### Window Control

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Room Sensor** | Binary sensor for fast reaction (window in the same room). |
| **Zone Sensor** | Binary sensor for slow reaction (e.g. whole-house "any window open"). |
| **Room/Zone Delay** | Time before turning off heating (default: 15s / 5min). |
| **Close Delay** | Time before restoring heating after windows close (default: 30s). |

### Schedule

| Option | Description |

## 🪟 Configuring Area-Based Window Control

### Prerequisites
1. **Areas configured** in Home Assistant (Settings → Areas & Labels → Areas)
2. **Window sensors assigned** to their respective areas
3. **Thermostats assigned** to their respective areas

### Setup Steps

1. **Create Climate Group** as usual with your thermostats
2. **Configure Window Control**:
   - Go to group settings → **Window Control**
   - Set **Window Control Mode** to **"Area-based Mode"**
   - Select all window sensors you want to monitor
   - Configure delays:
     - **Window Open Delay**: Time to wait before turning off thermostats (default: 15s)
     - **Close Delay**: Time to wait before restoring thermostats (default: 30s)

### Example Configuration

```yaml
# Areas in Home Assistant:
# - studio (Studio)
# - cameretta (Bedroom)  
# - bagno (Bathroom)

# Window sensors assigned to areas:
# - binary_sensor.finestra_studio_contact → studio area
# - binary_sensor.finestra_cameretta_contact → cameretta area
# - binary_sensor.finestra_bagno_contact → bagno area

# Thermostats assigned to areas:
# - climate.termostato_studio → studio area
# - climate.termostato_cameretta → cameretta area
# - climate.termostato_bagno → bagno area
```

### Behavior Example
- **Studio window opens** → After 15s → `climate.termostato_studio` turns OFF
- **Studio window closes** → After 30s → `climate.termostato_studio` restores to group mode (e.g., heat)
- **Other areas unaffected** by studio window changes

### Debug Logging
Enable debug logging to monitor window control activity:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.climate_group_helper.window_control: debug
```

## ⚠️ Fork Limitations & Warnings

### 🚨 **EXPERIMENTAL STATUS**
- This fork contains **experimental features** not present in the original
- **NOT RECOMMENDED** for production environments
- May contain bugs or unexpected behavior
- **No official support** - use at your own risk

### 🔧 **Technical Limitations**
- Area-based window control requires **Home Assistant Areas** to be properly configured
- Window sensors and thermostats **must be assigned** to their respective areas
- Only works with **binary sensors** for window detection (contact sensors, door sensors)
- **Threading warnings** may appear in logs (using future-compatible patterns)

### 🔄 **Migration from Original**
If you want to return to the original version:
1. Remove this custom integration
2. Install the original from HACS
3. Reconfigure your groups (settings may not transfer)

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

**Issues after updating?**
If you experience strange behavior after an update (e.g. settings not saving), try re-creating the group. This resolves potential migration issues.

To see more details, enable debug logging by adding the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.climate_group_helper: debug
```
