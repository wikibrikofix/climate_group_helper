## Core Features (Zero Config)

The "Minimalist Mode": Add your entities, and it just works. No complex setup required.

### Unified Control

Change settings on the group, and all member devices update to match. No more managing 5 thermostats individually.

### Smart Averaging

The group calculates the **mean** of all member temperatures to represent the true room reading.
*   **Averaging Method:** Choose between Mean (default), Median, Min, or Max.
*   **Precision:** Round target temperatures to device-compatible steps (0.5° or 1°). *Default: No rounding.*

## Advanced Features

Everything below is **optional**. If you don't configure it, the logic remains inactive and efficient.

### Master Entity

Designate a single climate member as the **Reference Point** or **Leader** for the group. This is the first thing you configure in the setup wizard — and once set, it unlocks additional options in every subsequent step (Sync Mode, Window Control, and Temperature/Humidity averaging).

*   **Centralized Target State:** Use the Master's target settings (temperature, humidity) as the group's goal, rather than calculated averages across all members.
*   **Hierarchical Sync (Master/Lock):** Enables a "Follow the Leader" sync mode. Changes on the Master are mirrored to all members; manual changes on other members are automatically reverted.
*   **Intelligent Window Control:** If enabled, only manual adjustments on the Master update the target state while windows are open. Changes on other devices remain ignored.

### External Sensors

Use **multiple external sensors** for temperature and humidity to override the member readings.

### Device Calibration

Write the external sensor value back to your TRVs to fix their internal temperature reading.

*   **Modes:** Absolute (Standard), Offset (Delta calculation), and Scaled (x100 for Danfoss Ally).
*   **Heartbeat:** Periodically re-sends the calibration value to prevent sensor timeouts on Zigbee devices.
*   **Battery Saver (Ignore Off):** Prevent sending constant calibration updates to wireless TRVs that are currently turned `off`. Configured in the Temperature step.

### Advanced Sync Modes

Beyond basic group control, you can mirror changes bidirectionally, enforce strict settings, or designate a leader.

*   **Standard:** Classic one-way control (Group → Members).
*   **Mirror:** Two-way sync. Change one device, all others follow.
*   **Lock:** Enforce group settings. Automatically reverts manual changes on all members.
*   **Master/Lock:** *(Requires Master Entity)* "Follow the Leader" mode — changes on the Master are mirrored to all members, while manual changes on other members are reverted.

*   **Selective Attribute Sync:** Choose **exactly** which attributes to sync (e.g. sync temperature but allow individual fan control).
*   **Partial Sync (Respect Off):** Prevents the group from waking up members that are manually turned `off`.
    *   **Ignore Off Members:** If a member is turned `off`, the group will not force it back on during synchronization (allows "Soft Off").
    *   **Last Man Standing:** Only when the *last* active member is turned `off`, the Group accepts this change and updates its internal **Target State** to `off`.

### Window Control

Binary sensor support to automatically turn off heating when a window opens and restore it when it closes.

#### Window Control Modes

**Legacy Mode (Room + Zone Sensors):**
*   **Room + Zone Sensors:** Supports fast-reacting room sensors vs. slow-reacting zone sensors (e.g. for whole floors).
*   **Configurable Delays:** Set custom reaction times for opening and closing.

**Area-Based Mode (Recommended):**
*   **Granular Control:** Only thermostats in the same area as the opened window are affected.
*   **Automatic Detection:** Uses Home Assistant's area registry to automatically associate windows with thermostats.
*   **Multi-Window Support:** Handles multiple windows in different areas simultaneously.
*   **Independent Timers:** Each window has its own delay timer.
*   **Smart Restore:** Restores only when all windows in the area are closed.

#### Common Options

*   **Window Action:** Choose between full `off` or a configurable temperature setpoint.
*   **Blocking:** While windows are open, manual changes are blocked. Schedule changes are accepted internally and applied when windows close.
*   **Adopt Manual Changes:** Optionally allow passive tracking:
    *   **Off (Default):** All manual changes are blocked and discarded.
    *   **All:** Any manual change updates the target state. Applied when windows close.
    *   **Master Only:** *(Requires Master Entity)* Only changes on the Master update the target state.

#### Area-Based Configuration

1. **Assign Areas:** Ensure windows and thermostats are assigned to areas in Home Assistant (Settings > Areas).
2. **Select Mode:** Choose `Area-based` in Window Control settings.
3. **Select Sensors:** Add all window sensors to monitor.
4. **Configure Delays:** Set window open delay (default: 15s) and close delay (default: 30s).

**Example Behavior:**
- Area "Living Room": `binary_sensor.living_room_window`, `climate.living_room_thermostat`
- Area "Bedroom": `binary_sensor.bedroom_window`, `climate.bedroom_thermostat`
- Open living room window → only living room thermostat turns off
- Open bedroom window → only bedroom thermostat turns off
- Close windows → respective thermostats restore independently

### Schedule Automation

Integrate native HA `schedule` helpers to automate your climate settings per time slot.

*   **Time Slots:** Set temperature and HVAC mode directly in the schedule's data.
*   **Dynamic Control:** Switch schedules on the fly via service call (e.g. for "Vacation" or "Guest" modes).
*   **Manual Overrides:** Stay in control. Set an **Override Duration** to automatically return to the schedule after manual adjustments.
*   **Sticky Override (Persist Changes):** If enabled, schedule changes are ignored while the override is active.
*   **Periodic Resync:** Force-sync all members every X minutes to ensure they match the target state.
*   **Schedule Persistence:** Optionally retain a schedule switched via service call across Home Assistant restarts.
*   **Window Aware:** If a schedule changes while windows are open, the new target is applied immediately when windows close.

### Schedule Configuration Example

1. Create a **Schedule Helper** in Home Assistant (Settings > Devices & Services > Helpers).
2. Open the schedule and add your time slots.
3. **Crucial:** You must add **variables** (data) to your schedule slots to tell the group what to do.

**Example (Edit Schedule as YAML):**
```yaml
monday:
  - from: "06:00:00"
    to: "08:30:00"
    data:
      hvac_mode: "heat"
      temperature: 21.5
  - from: "08:30:00"
    to: "16:00:00"
    data:
      hvac_mode: "heat"
      temperature: 19.0
```

## Configuration Options

The configuration is organized into a wizard-style flow. Use the **Configure** button on the helper to change these settings.

### Members & Group Behavior

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Master Entity** | Designate one member as the group's Leader. Enables Master/Lock sync mode, Master-aware window tracking, and centralized temperature/humidity target. |
| **HVAC Mode Strategy** | How the group reports its combined mode. See table below. |
| **Feature Strategy** | Which features the group exposes. See table below. |

### HVAC Mode Strategy

| Strategy | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| **Normal** | Group shows most common mode. Only `off` when all are off. |
| **Off Priority** | Group shows `off` if *any* device is off. |
| **Auto** | Smart switching between Normal and Off Priority. |

### Feature Strategy

| Strategy | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| **Intersection** | Features (e.g. Fan) supported by *all* devices. Safe mode. |
| **Union** | Features supported by *any* device. |

### Temperature & Humidity Settings

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **External Sensors** | Select one or more sensors to override member readings. |
| **Use Master Temperature/Humidity** | *(Requires Master Entity)* Use the Master's target value instead of averaging across all members. |
| **Averaging Method** | Mean, Median, Min, or Max—separately for Current and Target values. |
| **Precision** | Round target values sent to devices (e.g. 0.5° or 1°). |
| **Calibration Targets** | Write calculated temperature to number entities. Supports **Absolute** (Standard), **Offset** (Delta), and **Scaled** (x100) modes. |
| **Calibration Heartbeat** | Periodically re-send calibration values (in minutes). Helps prevent timeouts on devices that expect frequent updates. |
| **Ignore Off Members (Calibration)** | Prevents sending calibration updates to devices that are currently `off`, preserving battery life on wireless sensors and TRVs. |
| **Device Mapping** | Automatically links external sensors to TRV internal sensors using HA Device Registry (for precise Offset calculation). |
| **Min Temp Off** | Enforce a minimum temperature (e.g. 5°C) even when the group is `off`. This ensures valves are fully closed for frost protection (essential for TRVs that don't close fully in `off` mode). |

### Sync Mode

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Sync Mode** | Standard (One-way), Mirror (Two-way), Lock (Enforced), or Master/Lock *(requires Master Entity)*. |
| **Selective Sync** | Choose which attributes to enforce (e.g. sync temperature but allow local fan control). |
| **Ignore Off Members** | Prevent the group from forcing `off` members back on during sync. |

### Window Control

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Window Mode** | **Off** (disabled), **On** (legacy room/zone mode), or **Area-based** (automatic area detection). |
| **Window Action** | **Turn Off** (Default) or **Set Temperature**. Useful for frost protection. |
| **Adopt Manual Changes** | **Off** (block all), **All** (passive tracking for all members), or **Master Only** *(requires Master Entity)*. |
| **Window Temperature** | Target temperature to set when 'Set Temperature' action is selected. |
| **Window Sensors** | *(Area-based mode)* Select all window sensors to monitor. Only thermostats in the same area will be affected. |
| **Window Open Delay** | *(Area-based mode)* Time before turning off heating after a window opens (default: 15s). |
| **Room Sensor** | *(Legacy mode)* Binary sensor for fast reaction (window in the same room). |
| **Zone Sensor** | *(Legacy mode)* Binary sensor for slow reaction (e.g. apartment or floor). Room sensor should be part of zone sensor group. Active zone sensor prevents the group from being switched back on. |
| **Room/Zone Delay** | *(Legacy mode)* Time before turning off heating (default: 15s / 5min). |
| **Close Delay** | Time before restoring heating after windows close (default: 30s). |

### Schedule Automation

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Schedule Entity** | A Home Assistant `schedule` entity to control the group. |
| **Resync Interval** | Force-sync members to the desired group setting every X minutes (0 = disabled). |
| **Override Duration** | Delay before returning to schedule after manual changes (0 = disabled). |
| **Sticky Override** | Ignore schedule changes while a manual override is active. |
| **Retain Schedule Override** | Persist the active schedule entity across restarts when changed via `set_schedule_entity` service. Without this, the group always reverts to the configured default on restart. |

### Availability & Timings

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Debounce Delay** | Wait before sending commands. Higher values prevent 'rapid-fire' commands when sliding controls, but feel slower (default: 0.5s). |
| **Retry Attempts** | Number of retries if a command fails. |
| **Retry Delay** | Time between retries (e.g. 1.0s). |
